## Instructions from the Generative AI assistant

First, let's set up the project structure and necessary dependencies. You'll need to create a new React TypeScript project and install the required dependencies:

```
npx create-react-app school-management --template typescript
cd school-management
npm install @mui/material @emotion/react @emotion/styled @mui/icons-material
npm install @tanstack/react-query axios react-hook-form
npm install react-router-dom @types/react-router-dom
```
